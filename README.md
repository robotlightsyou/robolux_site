This is starting as a simple django site to test my ability to transfer
my Command Line Games Hub to a web app. Ultimately I hope to make a
oersonal portfolio site with a few extras. Stay tuned for updates as they
materialize.

The purpose of this repo is to use the knowledge gained in the Corey Schafer
Django tutorial series, and apply it to a project with parameters exceeding
scope of the tutorial to test material retention and understanding.
